A Helm package

It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster.

A **_Release_** is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. One chart can often be installed many times into the same cluster, e.g. 2 MySQL databases running in the same cluster.
