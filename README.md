# README
These are all the notes I take for all things CS. All of these notes reside locally in my Obsidian vault. 
Some docs will be short and incomplete, some will have greater depth. This repository is an exercise in humility.

Since this repository is hosted in Obsidian locally, there is some Obsidian specific syntax that will not show up on the remote repository, 
i.e. specifically, the links referencing other existing notes. You can use this repository as it is, if you find it useful. However I recommend cloning 
it to your Obsidian Vault on your local machine to make the best use of this. I'm a big fan of Obsidian's graphs and visualizing how notes relate to each other.
